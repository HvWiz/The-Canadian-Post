        Throughout history, people of color have been segregated, outcast, and even enslaved due to the color of their skin. Colonialism is the precursor towards all racism within Canada where black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) have not only experienced prejudice but also inequality at the federal level of government which has persisted to this day. The history of colonialism and racism in our country targets BIPOC and invokes a racial bias that is a part of Canada today can be illustrated by three aspects of Canadian history: residential schools, slavery, and the Komagata Maru incident.

        From the 17th century to the late 1990s, residential schools were prevalent in Canada, which led to the intergenerational trauma that exists today in indigenous communities. Racist ideologies towards Indigenous individuals and communities today originated from discriminatory policies such as residential schools in history. Indigenous youth were either manipulatively or forcefully separated from their family and community to attend in residential schools. These schools kept them from meeting their parents, denying them the right to practice or show any signs of their religion and culture, and constraining them to work and study the Catholic religion. The intent of this institution was to convert Indigenous youth to Catholicism and “to remove the savage from the child” for all future generations (John A. MacDonald). Phyllis Webstad- a famous residential school survivor - who founded orange shirt day explains how it felt to be a student at a residential school, “No matter how much all of us little kids cried, it didn’t matter. No one listened to us. Our feelings didn’t matter, we didn't matter”. This quote indicates that residential schools were truly racist and discriminatory, and made students feel as though they “didn’t matter”. Children who attended these schools experienced intense physical, emotional, and sexual abuse frequently. They were served malnourishing food, exposed to harsh weather, raped, molested, and unfairly disciplined. The establishment of residential schools by the Canadian government invokes racist actions and words in present Canada. For instance, the 751 unmarked graves found in British Columbia demonstrate that although we recognize that residential schools are problematic, we are still failing to act upon rectifying the brutal impact caused by our discriminatory society. Media coverage and extensive searches surrounding all residential schools is lacking and little initiative is shown by the government to excavate the remaining sites. Systematic racism helps privileged people when vulnerable, but harms marginalized people in society when they are vulnerable. Alongside racism in Canada, the era of segregation and slavery has impacted the BIPOC community severely.

        In the late 1600s, arguably the most racist time in Canadian history - slavery - arose. During this time, there were over 4,000 enslaved people who identified as African in British and French colonies across Canada. They were forced to work for and obey their masters, and almost all people of privilege had slaves. While few masters treated slaves well, most consulted them with derogatory language and hurtful terms of identification. They were treated with beatings and other physical consequences for minor disobediences. VIola Desmond was an activist of African descent who fought to abolish racism in Canada. “I thought you only go to jail if you’ve done something wrong - what’s happening here? … She did a wonderful thing”, said Viola Desmond’s  sister after Viola was detained for attempting to sit in the front row at a movie theater (Wanda Robson). Viola Desmond was discriminated against and her human rights were violated, along with those of countless others. Although Viola helped combat racism in Canada, racist events like this were inspired by colonialism, which often inspires racist events in our country today. Although even immigrants from across the globe were discriminated against and still are in Canada.

        On May 23, 1914, the Komagata Maru - a large ship containing 376 Punjabi passengers -  dropped anchor outside Vancouver, Canada. However, when they attempted to step foot in Vancouver, they were denied access. Multiple racist laws virtually prohibited Asians from immigrating to Canada. Firstly, the continuous journey law states that in order to enter Canada, one must make no stops from their origin country. This law prevented most Asians from traveling to Canada, people could not travel that far in 1914. Secondly, the $200 minimum wealth targeting Asian immigration stopped most people of color from immigrating to Canada. The government of Canada finally apologized for this event in 2016; over 100 years after the event. Justin Treaudeu offers “an apology on behalf of the government of Canada for [their] role in the Komagata Maru incident” (Trudeau). This crucial apology indicates the racism engraved into Canada’s history, as the racist act was not acknowledged until far too late. The discrimination that occurred in Canada is significant because it provokes discriminatory actions, words, and microaggressions, which begin from an educational setting.

        Present day racist events such as hate crimes and violence in Canada often are the consequence of racist ideologies developed from elementary and high school. In our school alone, many people exercise racist comments, gestures, and actions frequently. Therefore, students in elementary and high school must recognize the system that perpetuates racism in Canada. We, as a community, must work to decolonize Canada one school at a time. If students are taught to abolish racism throughout their childhood, racism will decrease and the BIPOC community will be safe from racism in society. We must learn from our past, as to see the past is to foresee the future. Join us in our pursuit to create a better world for all.
